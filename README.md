# The Modern React Bootcamp
## Section 1: A taste of React
**React** its a popular, powerful front-end framework/library Developed by and sponsored by Facebook. React makes it easy to make reusable "view components" encapsulating HTML and LOGIC into a class, often make it easier to build modular applications.
## Components: 
Component let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about ech piece in isolation.
- The building blocks of React
- Pieces of UI & view logic
## Section 2: Introducing JSX
JSX syntax allows us to combine our UI with our javascript logic directly on our javascript file, so rather than having a separate template file in HTML that we then call upon in our javascript we can look at a single component and directly see what it actually result it.  
- JSX isn's legal javaScript
- It has to be transpiled to JavaScript
- It can be use using Babel.
Basic Rules: 
- Have an explicit closing tag `<b></b>`
- Be explicity self-closed. `<input name="msg />`
- Cannot leave off that / or will get sytax error
## Section 3: Props and More
**Properties** aka PROPS allows us to make our components more customizables.
- Props are for configuring your component, for passing data in from a parent that help customize or configure a child component
- Properties are inmutable
